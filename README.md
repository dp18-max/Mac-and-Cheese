# Mac-and-Cheese
*This dish yeilds 4 servings*
**Ingredients**
[] 1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni
[] ¼ cup butter
[] ¼ cup all-purpose flour
[] ½ teaspoon salt
[] ground black pepper to taste
[] 2 cups milk
[] 2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

**Recipe**
- *Step 1*
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.

- *Step 2*
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.

- *Step 3*
Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated.

**Tips**
You can never have enough cheese, and I usually add an extra half cup without ruining the recipe. Keep a careful eye on the milk when boiling, as milk boils fast and burns easily. Burnt milk will show up in the recipes flavor if overcooked.
